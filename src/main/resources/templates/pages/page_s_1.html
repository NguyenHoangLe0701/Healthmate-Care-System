            The 10th most common cancer that affects women in Singapore,
            cervical cancer is a serious but largely preventable disease. Dr
            Wong Wai Loong, senior consultant gynae-oncologist at Mount Alvernia
            Hospital, elaborates on the must-knows of cervical cancer.
          </p>

          <h2>Why is regular cervical cancer screening important?</h2>
          <p>
            90 per cent of cervical cancer cases are caused by the Human
            Papilloma Virus (HPV), which is categorised into high risk and low
            risk strains. Only the high risk strains of HPV lead to the
            development of cervical cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            It takes many years from the time of HPV infection till the
            development of cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pre-cancerous changes to the cervix, known as cervical
            intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), is asymptomatic, so you may not be
            aware that there is anything wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this stage is very treatable and has a high chance of cure
            if detected early, which is why it is important to go for screening
            regularly. Regular screenings are pivotal in the early detection of
            abnormalities, enabling timely intervention and enhancing the
            chances of successful treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Screening for cervical cancer should begin from 25 years in women
            who have previously engaged in sexual intercourse.
          </p>

          <h2>
            What are the screening methods for cervical cancer and the
            differences between them?
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are two main methods to screen for cervical cancers: A HPV
            test and PAP smear. During these procedures, a speculum is inserted
            through the vagina to visualise the cervix, followed by the
            insertion of a brush to collect cells for analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The HPV test aims to detect presence of the high risk strains of the
            virus which may cause cancer, while a PAP smear is to identify any
            abnormal cells that may indicate the presence of
